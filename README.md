## Background

In today's data-driven world, the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning has become instrumental in addressing complex challenges, and one such challenge is to predict the success of charity funding applicants. Neural networks, a subset of machine learning, have emerged as a powerful tool in solving binary classification problems, which involve categorizing data into two distinct groups or outcomes. In this report, we will explore the development, optimization, and evaluation of a neural network model for a charity organization using the "charity_data.csv" dataset.

### Background on Neural Networks
Neural networks are computational models inspired by the human brain's structure and functioning. They consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized into layers, namely the input layer, hidden layers, and the output layer. Neural networks excel in their ability to learn intricate patterns and relationships within data, making them well-suited for a wide range of applications, including binary classification.

Neural networks have gained prominence in recent years due to their capacity to handle complex, high-dimensional datasets. They are particularly adept at discerning patterns in data that may be challenging for traditional statistical models to capture. This makes them an ideal choice for addressing problems like predicting the success of charity funding applicants, where a multitude of factors can influence the outcome.

### Uses of Neural Networks in Binary Classification
Binary classification is a common problem in machine learning, where the goal is to categorize data into one of two classes or outcomes. Neural networks have proven to be highly effective in this context due to their ability to model complex relationships, identify nonlinear patterns, and adapt to different types of data.

In the realm of charity funding, binary classification is often applied to predict whether an applicant will be successful if funded. Neural networks can analyze a diverse range of features, such as applicant demographics, financial information, and project details, to make informed predictions. By learning from historical data, neural networks can assist charity organizations in making objective decisions about allocating their resources.

## Overview

This report will detail the steps involved in developing a neural network model for binary classification, from data preprocessing to model optimization. The primary objective is to enhance the charity organization's ability to identify potential beneficiaries effectively, thereby maximizing the impact of their charitable efforts.

## Data Source

The data is provided by Alphabet Soup's business team in the form of a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. Within this dataset are a number of columns that capture metadata about each organization, such as:

* EIN and NAME—Identification columns
* APPLICATION_TYPE—Alphabet Soup application type
* AFFILIATION—Affiliated sector of industry
* CLASSIFICATION—Government organization classification
* USE_CASE—Use case for funding
* ORGANIZATION—Organization type
* STATUS—Active status
* INCOME_AMT—Income classification
* SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS—Special considerations for application
* ASK_AMT—Funding amount requested
* IS_SUCCESSFUL—Was the money used effectively?

## Methodology

### Preprocess the Data

Pandas and scikit-learn's `StandardScaler()` function was used to preprocess the data before compiling, training, and evaluating the neural network model. 

1. **Target and Feature Variables**: The first step is to create read the "charity_data.csv" file and identify the target and feature variables in the dataset. The target variable for our model is "IS_SUCCESSFUL," which indicates whether the funding provided was used effectively (1 for success, 0 for failure), and the feature variables include metadata about the organizations, such as "APPLICATION_TYPE," "AFFILIATION," "CLASSIFICATION," "USE_CASE," "ORGANIZATION," "STATUS," "INCOME_AMT," "SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS," and "ASK_AMT."
2. **Data Cleanup**: We dropped the "EIN" and "NAME" columns as they are identification columns and do not provide valuable information for the model.
3. **Unique Values**: We determined the number of unique values in each column to understand the diversity of data.
4. **Binning Rare Categories**: For columns with more than 10 unique values, we binned rare categorical variables into a new category called "Other." This helps prevent overfitting and simplifies the model.
5. **Encoding Categorical Variables**: We used pd.get_dummies() to encode categorical variables, converting them into numerical form for model input.
6. **Splitting Data**: The data was split into training and testing datasets to train and evaluate the model's performance.
7. **Scaling Data**: The data was scaled using a StandardScaler fitted to the training data, ensuring that all features have a similar scale for model convergence.

### Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model
1. **Neural Network Model**: We designed a neural network model with input features and nodes in each layer using TensorFlow and Keras.
2. **Model Architecture**: The neural network model consists of an input layer, one hidden layer with ReLU activation, and an output layer with a sigmoid activation function.
5. **Training and Evaluation**: The model was compiled and trained with a callback to save weights every five epochs.
We evaluated the model's performance using the test data, measuring loss and accuracy.
6. **Model Export**: The trained model results were saved and exported to an HDF5 file named "AlphabetSoupCharity.h5."

### Optimize the Model
1. **Repeated Preprocessing**: We repeat the preprocessing steps in a new notebook to ensure consistency.
2. **Create New Model**: We create a new neural network model implementing at least three model optimization methods to improve model performance.
3. **Save and Export**: The results of the optimized model are saved and exported to an HDF5 file named "AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization.h5".
